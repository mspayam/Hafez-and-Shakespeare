


Hafez





My friend, hold back your heart from enemies,


Drink shining wine with handsome friends like these;

With art’s initiates undo your collar –

Stay buttoned up with ignoramuses.





HOWEVER OLD, INCAPABLE,


And heart-sick I may be,

The moment I recall your face

My youth’s restored to me;

Thanks be to God that all I sought

From Him I have received,

That my exertions brought to me

The fortune I’ve achieved.

Rejoice, young sapling, in your glory,

For in your shadow there

I am the nightingale whose songs

Are heard now everywhere.

To me, at first, the heights and depths

Of Being were unknown,

But schooled within my longing for you

How well informed I’ve grown!

Fate drags me to the wine-shop’s door –

And though I turn and twist,

That’s where I always finish up;

It’s useless to resist.

It’s not that I am old in months

And years; if truth be told

The friend I love’s untrue to me –

It’s this that makes me old.

Within my heart, the door of meaning

Opened the day I sought

Our ancient Zoroastrian out

And entered in his court.

On Glory’s highway, and upon

Good Fortune’s throne, I raise

The wine-cup, and receive my friends’

Warm welcome and their praise!

And from that moment that your glance

First troubled me, I’m sure

I’ve been immune to all the troubles

The last days have in store.

Last night God’s kindness brought good news –

“Hafez, I guarantee

That all your sins will be forgiven;

Come back, return to Me!”





LAST NIGHT SHE BROUGHT ME WINE, AND SAT BESIDE MY PILLOW;


Her hair hung loose, her dress was torn, her face perspired –

She smiled and sang of love, with mischief in her eyes,

And whispering in my ear, she drunkenly inquired:

“My ancient lover, can it be that you’re asleep?

The true initiate, when offered wine at night,

Would be a heretic of love if he refused

To take the draught he’s given, and drink it with delight.”

And as for you, you hypocrites, don’t cavil at

Lovers who drain life to the lees, since we were given

This nature when the world began, and we must drink

The wine that’s poured for us, whether from earth or heaven.

So take the laughing wine cup, raise it in your hand,

Caress your lover’s curls, and say Hafez has spoken;

How many vows of abstinence the world has seen

So fervently affirmed, and – like Hafez’s – broken.





A FLOWER, WITHOUT A FRIEND’S FACE THERE, I THINK


that isn’t good

And springtime, if there isn’t wine to drink,

that isn’t good

A stroll through gardens, or a wooded place,

Without a pretty tulip-blushing face

that isn’t good

A cypress swaying, and a rose unfolding,

Without a nightingale’s melodious scolding

that isn’t good

A sweet-lipped, sexy lover near, if this is

To be with no embraces and no kisses

that isn’t good

Wine in a garden can be sweet, but when

We have no friend to talk and listen, then

that isn’t good

And anything the mind dreams, in the end,

Unless it is the features of our friend,

that isn’t good

The soul’s a useless coin, Hafez – not worth

Your casting, as an offering, on the earth

that isn’t good





I SEE NO LOVE IN ANYONE,


Where, then, have all the lovers gone?

And when did all our friendship end,

And what’s become of every friend?

Life’s water’s muddied now, and where

Is Khezr to guide us from despair?

The rose has lost its coloring,

What’s happened to the breeze of spring?

A hundred thousand flowers appear

But no birds sing for them to hear –

Thousands of nightingales are dumb:

Where are they now? Why don’t they come?

For years no rubies have been found

In stony mines deep underground;

When will the sun shine forth again?

Where are the clouds brimful of rain?

Who thinks of drinking now? No one.

Where have the roistering drinkers gone?

This was a town of lovers once,

Of kindness and benevolence,

And when did kindness end? What brought

The sweetness of our town to naught?

The ball of generosity

Lies on the field for all to see –

No rider comes to strike it; where

Is everyone who should be there?

Silence, Hafez, since no one knows

The secret ways that heaven goes;

Who is it that you’re asking how

The heavens are revolving now?





THE ORCHARD CHARMS OUR HEARTS, AND CHATTER WHEN


our dearest friends appear – is sweet;

God bless the time of roses! To drink our wine

among the roses here – is sweet!

Our souls’ scent sweetens with each breeze; ah yes,

the sighs that lovers hear – are sweet.

Sing, nightingale! Rosebuds unopened yet

will leave you, and your fear – is sweet;

Dear singer of the night, for those in love

your sad lament is clear – and sweet.

The world’s bazaar contains no joy, except

the libertine’s; good cheer – is sweet!

I heard the lilies say, “The world is old,

to take things lightly here – is sweet.”

Hafez, the happy heart ignores the world;

don’t think dominion here – is sweet.





SWEET LIPS AND SILVER EARS – THAT IDOL’S ELEGANCE


Has snatched away my fortitude, and my good sense;

So lovely, lithe, and lively, such a fairy face,

That Turk in his cute cloak, all wiles and nonchalance –

And I’m so mad about him, so on fire for him,

I’m like a cooking cauldron’s seething turbulence,

But I’ll calm down when I can grab that cloak from him

And be the shirt that covers up his impudence.

And when my bones are rotting, still my soul will not

Forget his kindness to me, his benevolence.

His chest and shoulders, chest and shoulders, bore away

My faith and heart, my faith and heart – I’d no defense!

So here’s your medicine, Hafez, here’s your medicine now –

Sweet lips, sweet lips, sweet lips are your deliverance!





COME, BOY, AND PASS THE WINE AROUND –


Love seemed a simple game

When I encountered it…but then

The difficulties came!

In longing for the musky scent

The breeze brings from her hair,

Such blood wells up in lovers’ hearts,

Such suffering, and despair…

What can ensure my happiness,

At love’s stage, in my heart?

When every instant now the bell

Cries, “Load up, to depart!”

And if the wine-seller says wine

Should dye your prayer-mat…dye it!

Pilgrims should know each stage’s rule

And seek to satisfy it.

On this dark night, amidst these waves,

The whirlpool’s fearsome roar,

What can they know of our distress

Who watch us from the shore?

In all I’ve done, I’ve pleased myself,

It’s ruined my good name –

The secret’s out, and everywhere

Men talk about my shame.

Don’t hide from Him you seek, Hafez;

You cannot hope to find

The One you’re longing for until

You leave the world behind.





NO ONE HAS SEEN YOUR FACE, AND YET


Thousands of rivals seek you;

You’re still a bud and yet a hundred

Nightingales entreat you.

However far I am from you

(May no one know that place!)

I cannot help but hope that soon

I’ll be in your embrace;

And it’s not strange that I should choose

Your street in which to wait –

Thousands of strangers in this world

Are in the selfsame state.

The loved one doesn’t spare a glance –

The lover must endure it;

And there’s no pain, or if there is

The doctor’s here to cure it.

In love, the Sufi meeting house

And wine-shop are one place;

As are all places where we find

The loved one’s radiant face;

And what the Sufis make a show of

Can be found equally

Among the monks, before their cross,

Within a monastery.

Hafez’s cry is not mere nonsense

When all is said and done;

Though it’s a strangely curious tale,

And a perplexing one.





TO TELL YOU NOW MY POOR HEART’S STATE


is what I long for

To hear the news that hearts relate

is what I long for

Look how naïve I am! To keep from rivals’ ears

A tale the winds disseminate

is what I long for

To sleep a sweet and noble night with you, to sleep

Till morning and to rise up late

is what I long for

And in the darkness of the night, to pierce the pearl

That is so fine and delicate

is what I long for

O morning breeze, abet me now, tonight, because

To blossom as dawn lies in wait

is what I long for

To use the lashes of my eyes, for honor’s sake,

To sweep the dust before your gate

is what I long for

Like Hafez, in contempt of prigs, to make the kind

Of poem libertines create

is what I long for





THANKS BE TO GOD NOW THAT THE WINE-SHOP DOOR


Is open, since it’s there I’m heading for;

The jars are groaning with fermented wine,

With wine that’s real, and not a metaphor,

That brings us drunkenness, and pride, and pleasure,

While we bring weakness, need, and not much more!

The secret I’ve not told, and won’t, to others

I’ll tell my friend – of him I can be sure.

It’s not a short tale, it describes the twists

In my belovèd’s hair, and lovers’ lore,

Majnun’s grief, Layla’s curls, Ayaz’s foot

That royal Mahmud’s face bowed down before;

And like a hawk I’ve seeled my eyes to all

The world, to glimpse the face that I adore.

Whoever strays within your street, it is

Your eyebrow’s curve that he will pray before;

O friends, to know the fire in Hafez’ heart

Ask candles what they’re burning, melting, for.





WINE IN MY GLASS, AND ROSES IN MY ARMS,


my lover near me –

On such a day the world’s great king would be

my slave and fear me.

No need to bring a candle to

our meeting place tonight;

My friend is there, the full moon of his face

will be our light.

Though wine in our religion’s not forbidden

(never think it!),

If you’re not there, my cypress-slender love,

how can I drink it?

Don’t sprinkle perfume where we meet –

the tresses of your hair

Each moment spread the fragrance of

such sweetness there…

My ears hear only plaintive flute-notes

and the harp’s sweet sound;

My eyes see only ruby lips

and wine-cups going round.

Don’t talk to me of sugar, or

of any food that’s sweet;

Sweetness for me is on your lips

when your and my lips meet.

I’ll haunt these ruins while within

the ruins of my heart

The treasure of my love for you

is lodged and won’t depart.

Why do you talk to me of shame – shame

has become my name –

Or reputation, when my reputation

is my shame?

We drink our wine, we flirt, and we’re

licentious – yes, but who

Is in this city where we live

of whom this isn’t true?

And don’t go to the morals officer

to make a fuss –

He’s on the constant lookout too for pleasure,

just like us.

This is no time to sit, Hafez,

without your wine and lover;

Jasmine’s and roses’ days are here,

and Ramadan is over.





GO, MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS, PREACHER! WHAT’S ALL


This hullabaloo?

My heart has left the road you travel, but

What’s that to you?

Until my lips are played on like a flute

By his lips’ beauty,

My ears can only hear as wind the world’s

Advice on duty –

God made him out of nothing, and within

His being’s state

There is a mystery no being’s skill

Can penetrate.

The beggar in your street disdains eight heavens

For what he’s given;

The captive in your chains is free of this world

And of heaven;

And even though the drunkenness of love

Has ruined me,

My being’s built upon those ruins for

Eternity.

My heart, don’t whine so often that your friend’s

Unjust to you;

This is the fate he’s given you, and this

Is justice too.

Be off with you, Hafez! Enough of all

These tales you tell;

I’ve heard these tales and fables many times;

I know them well.





WELCOME, SWEET FLOWER, NO ONE’S


More welcome in this land –

The more so since you hold

A wine-cup in your hand.

Enjoy this moment’s happiness,

Savor it well;

The pearl will not remain

Forever in its shell.

Grasp your good fortune! Drink

Among the flowers, since they

Will all have fled before

A week has passed away.

If you can fill a golden bowl

With wine now, give

Its draught to one who lacks

The gold with which to live.

Come, sheikh, and join in our

Carousing – you’ll be given

A draught of wine that you

Won’t ever find in heaven;

To learn with us, wipe clean

Your schoolbook’s pages; look –

The knowledge lovers learn

Is not in any book.

Hear what I say now, tie

Your heart to some sweet boy

Whose beauty’s not applied,

Whose prettiness won’t cloy.

O God, I pray, give me

A wine that will not make

Me drunk and crapulous,

Or cause my head to ache.

The man who’d criticize

Hafez’s poetry

Must have a brutal soul

Devoid of charity!

My soul’s a slave in thrall

To my Sultan Ovays,

And if he has forgotten me

That’s still the case,

And by his crown I swear

The sun itself can’t claim

A diadem more bright

And glorious than his name.





COME, SO THAT WE CAN SCATTER FLOWERS


and fill the glass with wine,

And split the ceiling of the skies

and try a new design!

If Sorrow sends her soldiers here

and wants a bloody fight,

My serving boy and I will put

them one and all to flight.

We’ll add rose water to our wine

and sugar will augment

The pungent aloes wood we burn,

and sweeten its fierce scent.

A fine lute’s in your hand, my friend,

so give us a fine song –

We’ll wave our hands and stamp our feet,

and dance, and sing along!

Sweet breeze, convey the dust of our

existence to that place

Where Splendor reigns – perhaps that way

we’ll see Him face to face…

One boasts about his intellect,

one’s all puffed up with pride;

Let’s bring these arguments before

our Judge – let Him decide.

Come join me in the wine-shop, friend,

if you want paradise;

I’ll tip you from the wine-cask to

Kosar’s stream in a trice.

Since in Shiraz poetic skill,

Hafez, goes unrequited,

It’s time to try another town

whose court is less benighted.





A CORNER OF THE WINE-SHOP IS


the temple where I pray;

My morning plea’s the prayer

the Zoroastrians say;

And if I miss the harp at dawn

I needn’t worry now –

My waking song’s my prayerful sigh

and my repentant vow.

Thank God I care for neither king

nor beggar! since I see

The poorest beggar at my friend’s

door is a king to me.

All I require from mosque and wine-shop

is to know your love;

As God’s my witness, this is all

that I’ve been dreaming of –

And since I’ve bowed my head down to

this threshold, I have known

The heavenly sun itself is where

I’m seated on my throne.

Until death’s dagger rends the tent

that is my life, my heart

Will not abjure his doorway – no,

I cannot now depart.

Though sin’s not ours to choose, Hafez,

keep to the disciplined

And noble way you’ve traveled on,

and say, “It’s I who’ve sinned.”





COME, TELL ME WHAT IT IS THAT I HAVE GAINED


From loving you,

Apart from losing all the faith I had

And knowledge too?

Though longing for you scatters on the wind

All my life’s work,

Still, by the dust on your dear feet, I have

Kept faith with you.

And even though I’m just a tiny mote

In love’s great kingdom,

I’m one now with the sun, before your face,

In loving you.

Bring wine! In all my life I’ve never known

A corner where

I could sit snugly, safely, and enjoy

Contentment too.

And, if you’re sensible, don’t ply me with

Advice; your words

Are wasted on me, and the reason is

I’m drunk; it’s true!

How can I not feel hopeless shame when I

Am near my love?

What service could I offer him? What could

I say or do?

Hafez is burned, but his bewitching love

Has yet to say,

“Hafez, I wounded you, and here’s the balm

I send for you.”





THOSE DAYS WHEN LOVING FRIENDS WOULD MEET –


long may they be recalled!

Those days gone by that were so sweet –

long may they be recalled!

My palate’s bitter with grief’s aftertaste: those cries

With which we drinkers would compete –

long may they be recalled!

And even though my friends have all forgotten me,

A thousand times I will repeat,

“Long may they be recalled!”

I’m wretched now, quite overthrown; the struggles of

My noble friends, in my defeat –

long may they be recalled!

My eyes run with a hundred streams; but Zendehrud,

And Karan’s pastoral retreat,

long may they be recalled!

Henceforth, Hafez’s secrets will remain unspoken,

Those confidants…Oh, I repeat,

“Long may they be recalled!”





LOST JOSEPH WILL RETURN TO CANAAN’S LAND AGAIN


– do not despair

His grieving father’s house will fill with flowers again

– do not despair

O sorrow-stricken heart, your fortunes will revive,

Order will come to your distracted mind again

– do not despair

And if the heavens turn against us for two days

They turn, and will not stay forever in one place

– do not despair

Sweet singing bird, survive until the spring, and then

You’ll tread on grass again, deep in the flowers’ shade

– do not despair

Don’t give up hope, you have no knowledge of Fate’s lore;

Behind the veil who knows what hidden turns still wait?

– do not despair

When, if you long to tread the pilgrims’ desert trail

To Mecca’s distant shrine, sharp thorns beset your path

– do not despair

For God, who solves all sorrows, knows the sorrows of

Our absence and desire, the guardian’s scornful rage

– do not despair

O heart, if nothingness should wash away the world,

Since Noah guides your craft, when you encounter storms

– do not despair

And though the journey’s filled with dangers, and its goal

Is all unknown, there is no road that has no end

– do not despair

O Hafez, in night’s darkness, alone, in poverty,

While the Qur’an remains to you, and murmured prayer

– do not despair





LAST NIGHT, NEWS OF MY DEPARTED FRIEND


Was brought to me upon the wind;

Whatever must come, let it come!

I give my heart now to the wind.

My life’s in such a state that my

Companions are the vivid flash

Of lightning in the dark of night,

And, as each dawn arrives, the wind.

Lost in the tangles of your hair

My shameless heart has never said,

“Oh, give me back the life I knew

Before I strayed like this, and sinned.”

My heart weeps blood remembering you,

Each time I see the meadows where

The budding rose’s cloak is loosed

And torn wide open by the wind.

My frail existence vanishes;

But may my soul rejoice again

And see you, and inhale your scent

Brought in the dawn, upon the wind.

Hafez, your noble nature will

Ensure your heart’s desire; and may

Our lives be given to such sweetness,

That’s borne away, upon the wind.





WHAT’S ALL THIS HIDING HAPPINESS AND WINE AWAY?


I’ve lined up with the libertines now, come what may.

Undo your heart’s knot, and ignore the heavens: since no

Astronomer’s undone that knot yet, let it go!

Don’t wonder at the revolutions we’ve lived through;

Time’s fashioned thousands of such fables – they’re not new!

But take the wine-cup reverently, since in your hand

Is Jamshid’s skull, and King Qobad’s, who ruled this land.

Who knows where Kay Kavus, or Bahman, have now gone?

Or what wind swept away King Jamshid’s royal throne?

From Farhad’s blood-red tears I see the tulips bloom –

He longs still for Shirin’s sweet lips, within his tomb.

You’d say the tulips know time’s treachery – since all

Their life they’re like a wine-glass, till their petals fall.

Come quickly, come, this wine will ruin us one day,

Unless these ruins hold a treasure – who can say?

Mosalla’s breeze, and Roknabad’s clear stream, have told me

I cannot leave this town; they will forever hold me.

Like Hafez, don’t drink till you hear the harp’s sweet sound

To which, with silken threads, his happy heart is bound.





I’VE KNOWN THE PAINS OF LOVE’S FRUSTRATION – AH, DON’T ASK!


I’ve drained the dregs of separation – ah, don’t ask!

I’ve been about the world and found at last

A lover worthy of my adoration – ah, don’t ask!

So that my tears now lay the dust before

Her door in constant supplication – ah, don’t ask!

Last night, with my own ears, I heard such words

Fall from her in our conversation – ah, don’t ask!

You bite your lip at me? The lip I bite

Is all delicious delectation! – ah, don’t ask!

Without you, in this beggarly poor hut,

I have endured such desolation – ah, don’t ask!

Lost on love’s road, like Hafez, I’ve attained

A stage…but stop this speculation – ah, don’t ask!





THAT YOU’RE A PIOUS PRIG BY NATURE


Doesn’t mean you have to blame

Libertines for their faults; those sins

Won’t be imputed to your name.

Each one of us will reap the seeds

He sows, so what is it to you

Whether I’m good or bad? To work on who

You are should be your aim.

Everyone searches for the Friend,

Whether they’re drunk or stone-cold sober;

And love’s in every house – the mosque

And synagogue are just the same.

I bow my head in worship on the bricks

That form the wine-shop’s threshold;

And if that blockhead doesn’t get it, then

It’s him who is to blame!

Don’t sadden me with tales of providence

And God’s eternal promise –

What do you know of who, behind the veil,

Can boast of beauty’s name?

It’s not just me who’s wandered out

Of lonely Piety’s front door;

My father let his chance of heaven’s grace

Elude him; I’m the same.

If this is who you are, the nature

You were given, then bravo!

And good for you if your fine character’s

Exactly as you claim!

O Hafez, on the last day, if you bear

A wine-cup in your hand,

You’ll go straight into heaven from the street

Of drunkenness and shame.





I SAW THE GREEN FIELDS OF THE SKY,


and there a sickle moon –

I reckoned what I’d sown, and thought,

“The harvest will come soon.”

I said, “My luck, you’ve been asleep;

now dawn has brought the sun.”

She said, “The past is past; do not

despair of all you’ve done;

The night you leave this world, go, climb

like Jesus through the skies –

Your lamp, a hundred times, will light

the sun as you arise.

Don’t trust the shining moon, she is

the highway robber who

Stole Kay Kavus’s throne, and then

the belt of Khosrow too.

Gold earrings set with rubies may

charm you, and lead you on,

But know this: Beauty’s reign is brief,

and all too quickly gone.”

God keep the evil eye from your

sweet beauty, which can field

A pawn to make the sun and moon

precipitously yield.

Say to the heavens, “Don’t boast of splendor!”

When love is matched with you,

The harvest of the moon’s a grain,

and of the stars but two.

Hypocrisy will burn the harvest

religion reaped; and so,

Hafez, shrug off this Sufi cloak –

just leave now, let it go.





WHAT’S SWEETER THAN A GARDEN AND GOOD TALK


When spring’s new flowers appear?

What’s keeping that young boy who serves our wine?

Tell me why he’s not here.

Put down as profit every happy moment

That Fate contrives to send;

Who has a notion what awaits us when

Our lives here have to end?

And understand, life hangs here by a hair;

That what you have to do

Is take care of yourself; since what are Time

And all its griefs to you?

The Water of Life, the Garden of Eram –

What could these blessings mean

But heart-delighting wine that’s poured and drunk

Beside some pretty stream?

Since abstinence and drunkenness share one

Descent, which has our voice?

Which should we give our skittish hearts to now?

What could decide our choice?

Who knows what lies beyond the veil? And your

Long boastful rant before

Its chamberlain, what point has that, you fool?

Shut up! Not one word more!

And if I’ve sinned and strayed, and there’s

A reckoning when I die,

What is it the Creator’s clemency

And mercy signify?

The ascetic longs to drink from Kosar’s stream

In paradise’s shade,

And Hafez longs for wine; until, between

The two, God’s choice is made.





LAST NIGHT I SAW THE ANGELS


tapping at the wine-shop’s door,

And kneading Adam’s dust,

and molding it as cups for wine;

And, where I sat beside the road,

these messengers of heaven

Gave me their wine to drink,

so that their drunkenness was mine.

The heavens could not bear

the heavy trust they had been given,

And lots were cast, and crazed

Hafez’s name received the sign.

Forgive the seventy-two

competing factions – all their tales

Mean that the Truth is what

they haven’t seen, and can’t define!

But I am thankful that there’s peace

between Him now, and me;

In celebration of our pact

the houris drink their wine –

And fire is not what gently smiles

from candles’ flames, it’s what

Annihilates the flocking moths

that flutter round His shrine.

No one has drawn aside the veil

of Thought as Hafez has,

Or combed the curls of Speech

as his sharp pen has, line by line.





FOR YEARS MY HEART INQUIRED OF ME


Where Jamshid’s sacred cup might be,

And what was in its own possession

It asked from strangers, constantly;

Begging the pearl that’s slipped its shell

From lost souls wandering by the sea.

Last night I took my troubles to

The Magian sage whose keen eyes see

A hundred answers in the wine;

Laughing, he showed the cup to me –

I asked him, “When was this cup

That shows the world’s reality

Handed to you?” He said, “The day

Heaven’s vault of lapis lazuli

Was raised, and marvelous things took place

By Intellect’s divine decree,

And Moses’ miracles were made

And Sameri’s apostacy.”

He added then, “That friend they hanged

High on the looming gallows tree –

His sin was that he spoke of things

Which should be pondered secretly;

The page of truth his heart enclosed

Was annotated publicly.

But if the Holy Ghost once more

Should lend his aid to us, we’d see

Others perform what Jesus did –

Since in his heart-sick anguish he

Was unaware that God was there

And called His name out ceaselessly.”

I asked him next, “And beauties’ curls

That tumble down so sinuously,

What do they mean? Whence do they come?”

“Hafez,” the sage replied to me,

“Their source is your distracted heart

That asks these questions constantly.”





LAST NIGHT, AT DAWN, IN MY DISTRESS, SALVATION


was given to me;

In darkness then, life’s water, a libation,

was given to me.

Rapt from myself by that pure lambent light,

The wine of essence, and of all creation,

was given to me.

O dawn of Fortune, moment of pure Glory,

That night when notice of my liberation

was given to me!

I gazed in Beauty’s mirror then, for there

My essence, shining for my contemplation,

was given to me.

If I was happy then, it’s no surprise –

I was deserving, and a just donation

was given to me.

That day a heavenly voice brought me good news;

The strength to bear this harsh world’s subjugation

was given to me.

It was Hafez’s spirit, and the sighs of those

Who rise at dawn, by which, at last, salvation

was given to me.





WHEN MY LOVE LIFTS HIS GLASS,


throughout the town

Love’s market suddenly

comes tumbling down.

I wept before his feet;

I could not stand –

Would he so much as lend

a helping hand?

I was a fish, I fell

into the sea

So that my lover’s hook

would lodge in me;

And anyone who saw

his eyes would say;

“Where’s the police, to haul

this drunk away?”

Happy the heart that lifts

a glass of wine

Whose vintage, like Hafez’s,

is divine.





PLANT FRIENDSHIP’S TREE – THE HEART’S DESIRE


Is the fruit it bears;

And uproot enmity – which brings

Sorrows and cares.

Be friendly, easy, with drunkards –

Good fellowship’s theirs;

It’s pride brings the hangover, not

The wine-seller’s wares.

Talk with your friends, deep in the night,

And see how life fares;

Since when we are gone the heavens

Will bring others our cares;

And welcome the spring in your heart

Since the world never spares

To provide for us roses and songbirds,

Whoever despairs.

And love your belovèd – the heavens require you

To be one who bears

The grief of Majnun all your life:

God grant me my prayers!

Your heart is so tired! You feel caught

In the weary world’s snares

But sip at your wine, and hear in your heart

The hope it declares:

That Hafez will sit in his orchard

By the stream that he shares

With his cypress-slim love, God willing,

In the place that is theirs.





TO GIVE UP WINE, AND HUMAN BEAUTY? AND TO GIVE UP LOVE?


No, I won’t do it.

A hundred times I said I would; what was I thinking of?

No, I won’t do it.

To say that paradise, its houris, and its shade are more

To me than is the dusty street before my lover’s door?

No, I won’t do it.

Sermons, and wise men’s words, are signs, and that’s how we should treat them;

I mouthed such metaphors before, but now – I won’t repeat them;

No, I won’t do it.

I’ll never understand myself, I’ll never really know me,

Until I’ve joined the wine-shop’s clientele, and that will show me;

I have to do it.

The preacher told me, “Give up wine” – contempt was in the saying;

“Sure,” I replied. Why should I listen to these donkeys braying?

No, I won’t do it.

The sheikh was angry when he told me, “Give up love!” My brother,

There’s no end to our arguing about it, so why bother?

And I won’t do it.

My abstinence is this: that when I wink and smile at beauty

It won’t be from the pulpit in the mosque – I know my duty;

No, I won’t do it.

Hafez, good fortune’s with the Magian sage, and I am sure

I’ll never cease to kiss the dust that lies before his door;

No, I won’t do it.





THAT BUSYBODY CRITICIZES ME


For loving love and revelry –

But it’s my knowledge of the hidden world

That motivates his enmity:

Don’t only look at faults and weaknesses,

See love in its totality –

It’s the untalented who always notice

Transgressions and deformity.

The fragrance of a houri’s borne upon

The wind now, and caresses me;

She dabs our tavern’s dirt inside her collar

Because its scent is heavenly –

And when our serving boy’s all smiles and winks

He slaps Islam’s austerity

So hard that even Sohayb wouldn’t shun

The red wine that he serves to me!

When friends meet heart to heart, this is the key

To happiness’s treasury;

May no one hesitate at such a time

Or hold back then, reluctantly.

The stories Hafez tells provoke our tears,

That fall, blood-red, since he

Recalls the time that lies between our youth

And our white-haired senility.





DRINK WINE DOWN BY THE GLASSFUL, AND YOU’LL TEAR


Out of your heart the roots of your despair –

Keep your heart open, like your glass, not sealed up

Like a flagon, stoppered and doctrinaire;

Drink down the wine of self-forgetfulness;

You’ll boast less once you’re not so self-aware.

Be stone-like in your steps, not like a cloud

That shifts its colors, gadding everywhere;

Rise, struggle like Hafez…And when you find

Your love, prostrate yourself before her there.





MY LOVE FOR YOU IS LIKE A YOUTHFUL TREE


of wonder

And meeting you is all that there can be

of wonder

My consciousness is now so drowned within

Our meeting that it’s like a whelming sea

of wonder

Neither the meeting nor the one who meets

Remain within this spectral fantasy

of wonder

Show me one face that seeks for him, that lacks

The dark mole of our incredulity

and wonder

And everywhere, from every side, I’ve heard

These searching questions put perpetually

in wonder

From head to toe Hafez’s being lives

Within his love for this same youthful tree

of wonder





AT DAWN, UPON THE BREEZE, I CAUGHT


the scent of my belovèd’s hair,

And once again my crazy heart

was laboring in its old despair.

Out of the garden of my breast

I’ve torn his sapling silhouette,

Since when my longings for him blossom,

grief is the bitter fruit they set.

Fearing the torment of his love,

I freed my heart from him; but when

My heart dripped blood, the path its drops

marked out…led back to him again.

I saw the full moon rise above

his castle’s roof, splendid and bright;

But when his shining sun arose,

the moon, for shame, concealed its light.

I took musicians at their word,

and always, everywhere, I sought

For messengers who’d traveled love’s

hard road, and all the news they brought.

My lover’s way, from end to end,

is good and kind, and little cares

Whether a man tells Moslem beads

or murmurs Christian prayers.

I was amazed to see Hafez

drink wine last night; but then I knew

Better than to object to this –

he drank as secret Sufis do.

May God forgive his eyebrow’s curve

That’s made me weak and powerless,

Since it can comfort, with a glance,

A sick man’s feverish distress.





DO YOU KNOW WHAT OUR HARPS AND LUTES ADVISE US,


when heard aright?

“Men say that wine’s unlawful – when you drink,

keep out of sight!”

They say you shouldn’t talk of love, or hear

love spoken of –

That’s a hard lesson that they’re teaching us,

to give up love.

Love’s beauty they despise – and as for lovers,

they deride them;

They mock the old, and tell the young that love

must be denied them.

I waited at the door, and was deceived

a hundred ways,

Longing to know what was decided there,

veiled from my gaze.

They pester the old Magian priest; look how

these devotees

Harass the old man with their scorn, and their

impieties…

One glance can buy a hundred different forms

of honor’s name –

And in this business it’s the pretty girls

who are to blame.

Some strive and strain and struggle to be with

the longed-for friend,

And others are content to let Fate send

what it will send.

But when all’s said and done, don’t trust the world’s

fidelity,

Since it’s a workshop where all things are changed

perpetually.

Bring wine! Qur’an reciters, clerics, sheikhs,

religion’s spies –

Look well at each of them, and see a man

who lives by lies.





WHAT MEMORIES! I ONCE LIVED ON


the street that you lived on,

And to my eyes how bright the dust

before your doorway shone!

We were a lily and a rose:

our talk was then so pure

That what was hidden in your heart

and what I said were one!

And when our hearts discoursed

with Wisdom’s ancient words,

Love’s commentary solved each crux

within our lexicon.

I told my heart that I would never be

without my friend;

But when our efforts fail, and hearts

Are weak, what can be done?

Last night, for old times’ sake, I saw

the place where we once drank;

A cask was lying there, its lees

like blood; mud was its bung.

How much I wandered, asking why

the pain of parting came –

But Reason was a useless judge,

and answers? He had none.

And though it’s true the turquoise seal

of Bu Es’haq shone brightly,

His splendid kingdom and his reign

were all too quickly gone.

Hafez, you’ve seen a strutting partridge

whose cry sounds like a laugh –

He’s careless of the hawk’s sharp claws

by which he’ll be undone.





THOUGH WINE IS PLEASURABLE, AND THOUGH THE BREEZE


Seems soaked in roses, see your harp

Is silent when you drink – because the ears

Of morals officers are sharp!

If you can find a wine jug and a friend,

Drink sensibly, and with discretion,

Because the dreadful days we’re living through

Are rife with mischief, and oppression.

See that you hide your wine-cup in your sleeve;

Your jug’s lip sheds its wine, blood-red –

And, in the same way, these cruel times ensure

Red blood is copiously shed.

We’d better wash away the wine stains from

Our cloaks with tears of penitence –

Now is the season for sobriety,

For days of pious abstinence.

The heavens have become a sieve that strains

Upon us blood, and it is full

Of bloody scraps like royal Khosrow’s crown,

Together with King Kasra’s skull.

Don’t think that as the heavens turn they’ll bring

A trace of solace or relief;

Their hurtful curvature is through and through

Made up of wretchedness and grief.

Pars knows the splendor of your verse, Hafez –

It’s made the towns of Eraq glad;

So now’s the time to try it out elsewhere –

Tabriz, perhaps, and then Baghdad.





MAY YOUR DEAR BODY NEVER NEED


A doctor’s expertise,

Your delicate existence know

No hurtful injuries.

Since all of our horizons’ health

Depends upon your own,

May ill-health never visit you

With noxious maladies;

And when the wind of autumn blows

Across these meadows, may

Its passage pass your stature by,

That’s like a cypress tree’s;

When your young beauty shows itself,

May spiteful gossip find

No sneaking opportunity

To spread its calumnies.

Outward and inward beauty spring

From your perfections! May

Your form be faultless, and your soul

Stay free from miseries –

And may the eye of one who casts

The evil eye on you

Be rue within your beauty’s flames,

Consumed by what it sees.

Your balm is Hafez’s sweet words –

And if you look for these

You won’t need rose water again

Or candied remedies.





TO HAVE MY HEART ACHIEVE ITS GOAL


grief melted my sad soul – to no effect;

And I was burned within the fire

of this inane desire – to no effect;

Alas, that in my questing for

wealth’s book, I’m now dirt-poor!

That universal ridicule

proclaims me sorrow’s fool – to no effect!

What pains I suffered as I sought

admission to his court,

Begging for alms, for charity

from those who’d comfort me – to no effect;

One night he joked and said, “It’s plain

I’ll be your chamberlain!”

Ah, how I’ve striven to deserve him,

to be his slave and serve him – to no effect.

He sent word saying that he’d be

with libertines like me

(Who’s called the Dregs-Drinker), so I

hoped that I’d catch his eye – to no effect.

I dreamed that in my drunkenness

I might achieve success

And kiss his ruby lips; but all

I drank was grief and gall – to no effect.

Without good reason never stray

upon the lovers’ way;

How cautiously I’ve traveled there,

beset with grief and care – to no effect.

Hafez has tried a thousand wiles,

a thousand tricks and trials,

Hoping that by his wits and zeal

He’d bring that boy to heel – to no effect.





YOU’VE SENT NO WORD OF HOW YOU ARE


It’s been a few days…quite a few –

And where’s our secret go-between

To take my messages to you?

I know that I can never reach

To your exalted sanctuary,

Unless your kindness makes you take

A few steps on the path to me.

The wine is poured into the jug,

The rose has flung away her veil –

So come now, drink a glass or two,

Seize joy, let happiness prevail!

Sugar dissolved in rose water

Won’t cure my heart; but if you could

Dissolve your curses in your kisses,

That distillation surely would.

Ah, puritan, pass by the street

Of shame, don’t let us interrupt you –

Don’t linger here with libertines,

Our sordid chatter might corrupt you!

You’ve numbered all the faults of wine,

So number all its virtues too;

Don’t throw out wisdom for the sake

Of what a few drunk oafs might do.

Beggars who crowd the wine-shop door,

God is your friend; but I advise you,

Don’t hope for gifts from cattle who

Think they’re your betters and despise you:

The ancient wine-seller was right

When he declared, “Don’t talk about

The secrets of your smoldering heart

To every passing, boorish lout.”

Hafez’s heart is smoldering with

His passion for your sun-like face;

All Glory’s yours, so spare a glance

For those defeated by disgrace.





NOT EVERY SUFI’S TRUSTWORTHY, OR PURE IN SPIRIT,


And burning is no more than many of them merit.

Our Sufi prays at dawn, transported with delight,

But watch how drunkenly he welcomes in the night!

Would that a touchstone could display hypocrisy,

Blackening the liar’s face with shame, for all to see.

The pampered are not fit to travel on love’s road,

Only an outcast’s heart can bear the lover’s load.

Why let the world upset you? Why, and for how long?

Drink wine, since sorrow in a wise man’s heart is wrong.

Our serving boy’s young face is ready for its beard –

What tearful faces there will be, once it’s appeared!

And if that boy should serve me now, it is a sign

Hafez’s cloak and prayer-mat have been sold for wine.





GOOD NEWS, MY HEART! THE BREATH OF CHRIST IS WAFTING HERE;


Its sweetness brings the scent of One who’ll soon appear.

Don’t cry and pray for exile’s sake; last night I cast

Our fortune, and an answer to your prayers draws near;

Not only I rejoice within this valley’s fire –

Moses, in hopes of borrowed embers, wanders here.

There is no one who has no business in Your street

And all are drawn here by the hopes that they hold dear –

No man can know where his Belovèd now resides,

But still the bell that summons him rings loud and clear;

And if a friend should ask how one grief-stricken fares,

Say, “Well! He’s breathing still – he’s not yet on his bier.”

But ask this garden’s nightingale for news, since cries

Of longing from within a cage are all I hear.

My friends, the Friend is hurting Hafez’s poor heart;

A falcon hunts a fly, or so it would appear!





MY LOVE HAS SENT NO LETTER FOR


A long time now – I’ve heard

No salutations from him, no

Inquiries, not one word;

I’ve written him a hundred times,

But that hard-riding king

Has sent no emissary back,

No message, not a thing!

I’m wild with waiting, crazy, but

He’s sent no envoy here –

No strutting partridge has turned up,

No graceful, skittish deer.

He knows my heart must now be like

A fluttering bird, but he

Has yet to send one sinuous line

To lure and capture me.

Damn him, that sweet-lipped serving boy

Knows very well that I

Need wine now, but he pours me none,

Although my glass is dry.

How much I boasted of his favors,

The kindnesses we’d share –

And now I’ve no idea at all

Of how he is, or where.

But this is no surprise, Hafez;

Calm yourself, and behave!

A king can’t be expected to

Write letters to a slave.





GOOD WINE, THAT DOESN’T STUPEFY,


That’s served by someone pretty – who

Among the wise men of this world

Escapes the snares set by these two?

It’s true, I’m dissolute, in love,

Known as a shiftless miscreant…

A thousand thanks, then, that this town

Provides friends who are innocent.

If you should step inside our wine-shop,

Look to your manners while you’re there –

The crowd that hangs around its door

Are the king’s cronies, so take care!

Cruelty is not the way of pilgrims,

Poor men who seek their journey’s end;

Bring wine! These “pilgrims” here are going

Nowhere, for all that they pretend.

But don’t despise the beggars lost

In hopeless love, don’t put them down –

They’re kings, though this one has no scepter,

Monarchs, though that one has no crown.

Don’t mar your loveliness, don’t let

The glory of your charm be shattered –

You’ll find your servants and your slaves

And all your retinue have scattered.

I am the slave of those who drink

Life to the dregs, but not of those

Who hide a blackened heart beneath

The showy splendor of their clothes.

Be ready, for a winnowing wind

Will blow – none of us shall remain,

And all devotion’s thousand harvests

Will not be worth a barley-grain.

Love is the nobler task – up then,

Hafez, and seek it while you may,

For lovers will not let the timid

Amble beside them on love’s way.





THE ONE WHO GAVE YOUR LOVELY FACE ITS ROSY


red and white

Can give me peace, and patience to endure

my wretched plight;

The One who taught your curls their airy

arrogance can give

Me justice to redress the hopeless grief

in which I live.

Oh, I despaired of Farhad when his hand

assigned the rein

Of his bewildered heart to Shirin’s lips,

and her disdain.

If treasuries of gold are lacking, well,

contentment’s beckoned;

The One who gives the first to kings sees beggars

receive the second.

The world displays herself to us as such

a charming bride,

But life’s the dowry that men pay to lie

at her sweet side.

From now on it’s the cypress and the clear

streams’ banks for me;

Especially now spring’s promise scents the breeze

incessantly.

“Justice!” I cry. And since, Qavam al-din,

we’ve had to part,

This age’s grief, your absent face, usurp

Hafez’s heart.





MAY I REMEMBER ALWAYS WHEN


Your glance in secrecy met mine,

And in my face your love was like

A visibly reflected sign.

May I remember always when

Your chiding eyes were like my death

And your sweet lips restored my life

Like Jesus’s reviving breath.

May I remember always when

We drank our wine as darkness died,

My friend and I, alone at dawn,

Though God was there too, at our side.

May I remember always when

Your face was pleasure’s flame, and my

Poor fluttering heart was like a moth

That’s singed and is about to die.

May I remember always when

The company that we were in

Was so polite, and when it seemed

Only the wine would wink and grin!

May I remember always when

Our goblet laughed with crimson wine –

What tales passed back and forth between

Your ruby lips, my dear, and mine!

May I remember always when

I was a canopy unfurled

That shaded you, and you were like

The new moon riding through the world.

May I remember always when

I sat and drank in wine-shops where

What I can’t find in mosques today

Accompanied the drinkers there.

May I remember always when

The jewels of verse Hafez selected

Were set out properly by you,

Arranged in order, and corrected.





THESE PREACHERS WHO MAKE SUCH A SHOW


Of pulpit piety

Act in a wholly different way

When no one’s there to see.

This is my question for the wise –

How is it those who teach

Repentance are so rarely found

To practice what they preach?

You’d think they’d no belief in God

Or in His Judgment Day,

Given their frauds done in His name,

The pious tricks they play.

My master reigns among the ruins,

And the poor whom he

Attracts know needing nothing’s wealth,

And pride’s humility.

O God, these nouveaux riches – the slaves

And mules that they display!

Set them upon their donkeys now,

And send them on their way!

And angels, say your prayers before

Love’s tavern door – its shade

Is where the clay of Adam’s kneaded

And mankind is made.

His boundless beauty slays the lover,

And even as he dies,

Out of the darkness, seeking love,

New multitudes arise.

But hurry, Sufi – in the house

Where Magians meet they give

The liquid that revives men’s hearts

And makes them truly live.

Empty your house, my heart, so that

Your Sovereign may preside there,

Since grasping fools despoil both heart

And soul when they reside there.

At dawn a cry came from the heavens –

And Reason said, “I see

The very angels know by heart

Hafez’s poetry!”





THE NIGHTINGALES ARE DRUNK, WINE-RED ROSES APPEAR,


And, Sufis, all around us, happiness is here;

How firmly, like a rock, Repentance stood! Look how

A wine-glass taps it, and it lies in pieces now…

Bring wine! From the sequestered court where we’re secluded,

Drunk or sober, king or soldier, none will be excluded;

This inn has two doors, and through one we have to go –

What does it matter if the doorway’s high or low?

If there’s no sorrow there can be no happiness,

And, when the world was made, men knew this, and said, “Yes.”

Rejoice, don’t fret at Being and Non-Being; say

That all perfection will be nothingness one day.

The horse that rode the wind, Asef in all his glory,

The language of the birds, are now an ancient story;

They’ve disappeared upon the wind, and Solomon,

The master of them all, has nothing now they’ve gone.

Don’t rise on feathered wings, don’t soar into the skies –

An arrow falls to earth, however far it flies;

How will your pen give thanks, Hafez, now men demand

Your verses everywhere, and pass them hand to hand?





MOSLEMS, TIME WAS I HAD A HEART –


a good one too,

When problems came we’d talk, and I’d

know what to do;

And if I tumbled in grief’s whirlpool

my heart was sure

To give me hope that soon enough

I’d reach the shore –

A sympathetic, generous heart,

a heart prepared

To help out any noble soul,

a heart that cared.

This heart was lost to me within

my lover’s street;

God, what a place! – where I succumbed

to sweet deceit.

There is no faultless art – we all

fall short somehow,

But what poor beggar’s more deprived

than I am now?

Have pity on this wretched soul

and sympathize

With one who once upon a time

was strong and wise.

Since love has taught me how to talk,

each little phrase

Of mine is cried up everywhere

and showered with praise –

But don’t call Hafez witty, wise,

intelligent;

I’ve seen Hafez, I know him well;

he’s ignorant.





PERHAPS, MY HEART, THE WINE-SHOPS’ DOORS


will soon be opened wide,

And all the cramping knots in which

we’re tied will be untied;

And if they’re closed because of one

ascetic’s canting pride,

Be strong, my heart…because of God

this will be rectified.

I swear by revelers’ hearts that those

who drink at dawn have pried

Apart with prayers so many doors –

their prayers were satisfied.

Write now the elegy for grape’s

fair child, since she has died!

And make her mourners weep with such

despair it’s blood they’ve cried.

Sever the harp’s strings now in grief

for wine’s cruel homicide;

Likewise the locks of those young boys

who served wine at our side.

They’ve closed the wine-shops’ doors – ah, God,

don’t let them open wide

The doors to shops whose wares are cant,

pretentiousness, and pride.

Hafez, this Sufi cloak you wear,

tomorrow it won’t hide

The heathen underneath, and all

you’ve claimed will be belied.





WE HAVEN’T TRAVELED TO THIS DOOR


For wealth or mastery,

We come here seeking refuge from

Misfortune’s misery.

And we have journeyed all this way,

Fleeing the confines of

Our Nothingness to seek out Being

Along the path of love;

From heaven’s orchards we have seen

The springtime of your face,

We traveled here from paradise

To seek this herb of grace –

For all the treasures Gabriel

Kept in store for us there,

We’ve traveled to our Sovereign’s door

Like beggars in despair.

O Holy Ship of Blessings, where

Is Your strong anchor found?

In sinfulness, within this sea

Of mercy, we are drowned!

Our good name’s gone…cover our sins,

Kind Cloud of Grace – we bring

A blackened record with us to

The precincts of our King.

Hafez, cast off this Sufi cloak

And all it signifies –

We’ve followed here the camel-train

With ardent, fiery sighs.





I SAID, “THE GRIEF I FEEL IS ALL FOR YOU”;


she said, “Your grief will end”;

I said, “Be as the moon to me”; she said,

“That moon might rise, my friend.”

I said, “Learn faithfulness from those whose love

is trustworthy and true”;

She said, “That’s something moon-like pretty girls

are rarely known to do.”

I said, “I’ll bind my eyes up, and I’ll keep

your image from my sight”;

She said, “My image is a thief that moves

invisibly by night.”

I said, “Your curls’ scent has misled my mind,

I wander far and wide”;

She said, “And when you understand you’ll see

that scent is your true guide.”

I said, “Happy the scent from beauty’s garden,

blowing so fresh and sweet”;

She said, “Cool is the breeze that blows on us

from the belovèd’s street.”

I said, “Wanting to kiss your ruby lips

has all but murdered me”;

She said, “Be as a slave, my lips know how

to treat slaves lovingly.”

I said, “When will your generous heart make peace

between us – when, my dear?”

She said, “Don’t speak of this at all until

my heart says peace is here.”

I said, “And did you see how happiness

sped by, and could not last?”

She said, “Silence, Hafez; this time of grief

will also, soon, have passed.”





DEAR FRIENDS, THAT FRIEND WITH WHOM WE ONCE


Caroused at night –

His willing services to us

And our delight…remember this.

And in your joy, when tinkling bells

And harps are there,

Include within your songs the sound

Of love’s despair…remember this.

When wine bestows a smile upon

Your server’s face,

Keep in your songs, for lovers then,

A special place…remember this.

So all that you have hoped for is

Fulfilled at last?

All that we talked of long ago,

Deep in the past…remember this.

When love is faithful, and it seems

Nothing can hurt you,

Know that the world is faithless still

And will desert you…remember this.

If Fortune’s horse bolts under you,

Then call to mind

Your riding whip, and see your friends

Aren’t left behind…remember this.

O you, who dwell in splendor now,

Glorious and proud,

Pity Hafez, your threshold’s where

His face is bowed…remember this.





IT IS THE NIGHT OF POWER,


Grief’s scroll is rolled away,

Peace to this sacred night

until the dawning day!

My heart, as you traverse

love’s path, be strong and true –

No step along this way

will be denied its due.

A libertine is all

I am, I can’t repent –

Although it means that you’ve

decreed my banishment.

My heart’s gone, and I missed

the face of its sly thief;

My cries are for my sorrow,

my sighs are for my grief.

Bring the bright morning to

my heart, O God; the night

That separation brings

obliterates my sight.

If you want faith, Hafez,

put up with faithlessness –

Merchants see loss and profit,

both failure and success.





LIFE’S GARDEN FLOURISHES WHEN YOUR


Bright countenance is here.

Come back! Without your face’s bloom

The spring has left the year.

If tears course down like raindrops now,

It’s no surprise, it’s right –

My life’s flashed by in longing for you

As lightning splits the night.

Seize these few moments while we’ve still

Time for our promised meeting,

Since no one knows what life will bring

And life, my dear, is fleeting.

How long shall we enjoy our dawns’

Sweet sleep, our morning wine?

Wake up, and think of this! Since life’s

Not yours for long, or mine.

She passed by yesterday, but gave

Me not a glance, not one;

My wretched heart, you’ve witnessed nothing

As life’s passed by, and gone.

But those whose lives are centered on

Your lovely mouth confess

No other thoughts than this, and think

Nothing of Nothingness.

An ambush waits on every side

Wherever we might tread,

And so life’s rider rides slack-reined,

Giving his horse its head.

I’ve lived my life without a life –

Don’t be surprised at this;

Who counts an absence as a life

When life is what you miss?

Speak Hafez! On the world’s page trace

Your poems’ narrative;

The words your pen writes will have life

When you no longer live.





OF ALL THE ROSES IN THE WORLD


A rosy face…is quite enough for me;

Beneath this swaying cypress tree

A shady place…is quite enough for me.

May hypocrites find somewhere else

To cant and prate –

Of all this weighty world, a full

Wine-glass’s weight…is quite enough for me.

They hand out heaven for good deeds!

The monastery

Where Magians live is better for

A sot like me…that’s quite enough for me.

Sit by this stream and watch as life

Flows swiftly on –

This emblem of the world that’s all

Too quickly gone…is quite enough for me.

See how the world’s bazaar pays cash,

See the world’s pain –

And if you’re not content with this

World’s loss and gain…they’re quite enough for me.

My friend is here with me – what more

Should I desire?

The riches of our talk are all

That I require…they’re quite enough for me.

Don’t send me from your door, O God,

To paradise –

For me, to wait here at Your street’s

End will suffice…that’s quite enough for me.

Hafez, don’t rail against your fate!

Your nature flows,

As does your verse, like water as

It comes and goes…that’s quite enough for me.





A LOVING FRIEND, GOOD WINE, A PLACE SECURE


From enemies –

What luck is yours if you can always lay

Your hands on these!

The world, with all its works, amounts to nothing,

With naught inside it –

A thousand times I’ve puzzled over this

And verified it.

Alas that I was ignorant till now –

But now I’m sure

The alchemy of joy’s the friend, the friend

And nothing more.

Go somewhere safe, treasure the time you’re given,

See you enjoy it –

Since bandits lie in wait to snatch your life,

And they’ll destroy it.

Come now – repentance over ruby lips

And wine’s red smile

Is just a whim, and one that Reason can’t

Count as worthwhile.

And if your slender waist’s not destined for

The likes of me,

I still know happiness when I invoke

Its memory;

And then your chin, that’s so delectable

And sweet I swear

A hundred thousand fancies could not plumb

The dimple there…

My tears are ruby-red, but that should come

As no surprise –

Your lips are ruby-red, it’s tears for them

That fill my eyes.

He laughed, “Hafez, I am the slave of your

Poetic nature –

Look what an utter fool he takes me for,

A stupid creature!”





LAST NIGHT THE WINE-SELLER, A MAN


Of great experience,

Conversed with me (and here I share

With you his secret sense):

“Go easy on yourself – the world’s

Harsh nature is to be

Hard on the man who’s hard upon

Himself continually.”

And then he gave me such a glass

Of wine its flashing light

Made Venus dance in heaven, and strike

Her lute in shared delight,

And cry, “Good health!” And he went on:

“Listen my boy, draw near,

Let sorrow go, take my advice,

If you have ears to hear;

And if your heart is red with blood,

Smile as red wine will smile;

Don’t cry out like a harp’s strings, though

You’re grieving all the while.

Until you pass this veil you can’t

Arrive at what is hidden;

To impure ears Sorush’s words

Must still remain forbidden.

But when it comes to love, life’s all

A listening and a speaking –

We must be then all open eyes

And ears forever seeking;

And self-promotion’s not the mode

A clever man employs –

Speak if you’ve knowledge, otherwise

See that you make no noise!”

Bring wine! Asef, the Lord of Time,

Who’s gracious and forgiving,

Already knows the dissipation

In which Hafez is living.





LOVE’S ROAD’S AN ENDLESS ROAD


where there’s no place to rest,

Where souls must sacrifice

themselves, and not protest;

Each moment that you give

your heart to love is good,

And there’s no need to see

what omens might suggest;

So take the libertine’s

sweet way; not every man

Is shown the road that leads

to such a treasure chest!

Don’t frighten us by saying

Reason prohibits it;

In our town that police-chief

has made not one arrest.

Clear eyes can glimpse Him, as

they glimpse the new moon’s sliver,

And not to every gaze

is this made manifest.

So ask your own eyes then

just who it is who slays us;

Stars have not sinned here, nor

have horoscopes transgressed!

Hafez’s tears have no

effect at all; you are

Like granite, as my heart’s

bewilderments attest.





MY HEART, GOOD FORTUNE IS THE ONLY FRIEND


Going along beside you that you need;

A breeze that’s scented with Shiraz’s gardens

Is all the guard to guide you that you need.

Poor wretch, don’t leave your lover’s home again,

Don’t be in such a hurry to depart –

A corner of our Sufi meeting place,

The journey in your heart…are all you need.

The claims of home, the promises you made

An ancient friend – these are enough to say

When making your excuses to the travelers

Who’ve been along life’s way…they’re all you need.

If grief should leap out from some corner of

Your stubborn heart and ambush you, confide

Your troubles to our ancient Zoroastrian –

His precincts will provide…you all you need.

Sit yourself down upon the wine-shop’s bench

And take a glass of wine – this is your share

Of all the wealth and glory of the world,

And what you’re given there…is all you need.

Let go, and make life easy for yourself,

Don’t strain and struggle, always wanting more;

A glass of wine, a lover lovely as

The moon – you may be sure…they’re all you need.

The heavens give the ignorant their head,

Desire’s the only bridle they acknowledge –

Your fault is that you’re clever and accomplished,

And this same sin of knowledge…is all you need.

And you require no other prayer, Hafez,

Than that prayed in the middle of the night;

This and the morning lesson you repeat

As dawn displays her light…are all you need.

Don’t look for gifts from others; in both worlds –

This world, the world that is to come – your king’s

Kind bounty, and the Lord’s approval, are

The two essential things…they’re all you need.





ALTHOUGH OUR PREACHER MIGHT NOT LIKE


to hear me mention it,

He’ll never be a Moslem while

he’s such a hypocrite.

Learn to be dissolute; be kind –

this is far better than

To be a beast that won’t drink wine

and can’t become a man.

The essence must be wholly pure

if grace is to be ours;

If not, no stones will turn to pearls,

or coral come from flowers.

The Highest will fulfill His aims,

rejoice, my heart! No lies

Can make a devil Solomon

whatever tricks he tries.

I practice love, a noble trade,

and hope that I won’t see

Love bring, as other trades have done,

sorrow and grief to me.

Last night he said, “Tomorrow I

will give you your desire.”

O God, don’t let regret assail him

and make him out a liar!

I’ll pray that God adds goodness to

the beauty you possess,

So that you’ll cease to cause me such

distraction and distress.

Hafez, unless a mote aspires

and strives, it has no chance

To reach that source from which the sun

receives its radiance.





WHEN YOU DRINK WINE, SPRINKLE


A few drops on the ground –

What’s there to fear from sin

That spreads such joy around?

Go, drink up all you have,

Drink now and don’t delay –

Death’s dagger won’t delay

Dispatching you one day.

My cypress-slender love,

By the dust on which you tread,

Don’t hesitate to visit

My dust when I am dead.

In heaven or in hell,

For angels or for men,

In every faith – to hold back

Counts as a mortal sin.

The Architect of heaven

Who gave the world its shape

Has sealed its six directions

So that there’s no escape.

The daughter of the vine

Leads Reason all astray –

May the vine’s trellis stand

Unharmed till Judgment Day!

And may your dear friends’ prayers,

Hafez, when you depart

Via the wine-shop’s door,

Accompany your heart.





MY HEART WAS STOLEN BY A LOUT,


A gypsy-featured lad

Who broke his promises and was

Half cut-throat and half mad.

I’d rather see a ripped shirt worn

By someone blessed with beauty

Than see a thousand Sufi cloaks,

All abstinence and duty.

An angel has no notion what

Love is when it’s discussed,

No, call for rose water, my boy

To pour on Adam’s dust.

I love the words that kindle fire,

A verbal conflagration,

Not cold words used to douse the flames

Of friendly conversation.

I’ve come now to your court, worn out

By pain and indigence;

Have mercy on me, I’ve no hope

But your benevolence.

Don’t put your trust in all the tricks

And games that you’ve created;

It’s said there are a thousand ways

For kings to be checkmated.

“Come then,” a voice within the wine-shop

Last night admonished me,

“You’ve gained contentment, now accept

This stage as Fate’s decree.”

Attach a wine-cup to my shroud

So that on Judgment Day

The wine will help my quaking heart

Chase all her fears away.

Between the lover and the loved

There will be no divide,

But you yourself, Hafez, must draw

The veil of Self aside.





GOOD NEWS! THE DAYS OF GRIEF AND PAIN


won’t stay like this –

As others went, these won’t remain

or stay like this.

Though my belovèd thinks of me

as dirt and dust,

My rival’s status, and her trust,

won’t stay like this.

And though the doorman wields his sword

against us all,

No rank remains immutable

or stays like this.

When good or bad come, why give thanks,

and why complain?

Since what is written won’t remain

or stay like this.

They say when Jamshid reigned, “Bring wine”

was his court’s song,

“Since even Jamshid won’t live long,

or stay like this.”

And if you’re wealthy help the poor,

since, be assured,

The gold and silver that you hoard

won’t stay like this!

O candle, prize the moth’s love now

and hold it fast –

When dawn arrives it cannot last

or stay like this.

In words of gold they’ve written on

the emerald sky,

“Only compassion does not die

but stays like this.”

Do not despair of love, Hafez;

it can’t be true

The heartlessness she’s shown to you

will stay like this.





I’LL SAY IT OPENLY, AND BE


Happy to speak my mind –

“I am the slave of love, and I

Have left both worlds behind.”

I am a bird from paradise

And can’t account for how

I fell into this trap of troubles

Where I must languish now.

I was an angel, the highest court

Of heaven was home to me –

Adam it was who brought me to

This ruined monastery.

But heavenly shade, the water there,

The houris’ proffered love

Are all forgotten now, and it’s

Your street I’m dreaming of;

And on the tablets of my heart

My friend’s tall stature’s written;

What can I do? My master’s lesson

Was this, and now I’m smitten.

No wise astrologer can tell

What star’s assigned to me;

O God, when earth, my mother, bore me,

What did the heavens decree?

A slave before love’s wine-shop door

Is where and how I live,

And every moment brings to me

The blessings sorrows give.

My eyes weep heart’s blood – this is right

Given what I have done;

Why did I hand my heart to one

Beloved by everyone?

Oh, use your hair to wipe the tears

From your Hafez’s face,

Or soon their flood will bear me off

And leave behind no trace.





AH, GOD FORBID THAT I RELINQUISH WINE


When roses are in season;

How could I do this when I’m someone who

Makes such a show of Reason?

Where’s a musician, so that I can give

The profit I once found

In self-control and knowledge for a flute’s songs,

And a lute’s sweet sound?

The endless arguments within the schools –

Whatever they might prove –

Sickened my heart; I’ll give a little time

To wine now, and to love.

Where is the shining messenger of dawn

That I might now complain

To my good fortune’s harbinger of this

Long night of lonely pain?

But when did time keep faith with anyone?

Bring wine, and I’ll recall

The tales of kings, of Jamshid and Kavus,

And how time took them all.

I’m not afraid of sins recorded in

My name – I’ll roll away

A hundred such accounts, by His benevolence

And grace, on Judgment Day.

This lent soul, that the Friend once gave into

Hafez’s care, I’ll place

Within His hands again, on that day when

I see Him face to face.





MILD BREEZE OF MORNING, GENTLY TELL


That errant, elegant gazelle

She’s made me wander far and wide

About the hills and countryside.

My sugar-lipped, sweet girl – oh, may

You live forever and a day! –

Where is your kindness? Come now, show it

To your sweet-talking parrot-poet.

My rose, does vanity restrain you?

Does beauty’s arrogance detain you

From seeking out this nightingale

Who wildly sings, to no avail?

With gentleness and kindness lies

The surest way to win the wise,

Since birds that have become aware

Of ropes and traps are hard to snare.

When you sit safely with your love,

Sipping your wine, be mindful of

Those struggling lovers who still stray,

Wind-tossed, upon their weary way.

I don’t know why she isn’t here,

Why her tall presence won’t appear,

Or why the full moon of her face,

And her black eyes, avoid this place.

No fault can be imputed to

Your beauty’s excellence, or you,

Except that there is not a trace

Of truth or kindness in your face.

When Hafez speaks, it’s no surprise

If Venus dances in the skies

And leads across the heavens’ expanse

Lord Jesus in the whirling dance.





WHERE IS THE NEWS WE’LL MEET, THAT FROM


This life to greet you there

I may arise?

I am a bird from paradise,

And from this world’s cruel snare

I will arise.

Now by my love for you, I swear

That if you summon me

To be your slave, from all existence

And its sovereignty

I will arise.

O Lord, make rain fall from Your cloud

Sent to us as a guide,

Send it before, like scattered dust

That’s wind-blown far and wide,

I will arise.

Sit by my dust with wine and music:

From my imprisonment

Beneath the ground, within my grave,

Dancing, drawn by your scent,

I will arise.

Rise now, my love, display your stature,

Your sweetness, and I’ll be,

Like Hafez, from the world itself

And from my soul set free…

I will arise.

And though I’m old, if you’ll embrace

Me tightly in your arms all night,

Then from your side, as dawn appears,

Young in the morning light,

I will arise.





MY LOVE’S FOR PRETTY FACES,


For heart-bewitching hair;

I’m crazy for good wine,

A languorous, drunk stare…

In love there’s no escaping

The burning of desire;

I stand here like a candle –

Don’t scare me with your fire.

I am a man from heaven,

But on this path I see

My love of youth and beauty

Have made a slave of me.

If Fate will help me, I

Will take myself elsewhere –

My bed will be swept clean

By some sweet houri’s hair.

Shiraz is like a mine

Of ruby lips, a store

Of loveliness…and I’m

A jeweler who’s dirt-poor.

I’ve seen so many drunk

Eyes in this town, I think

I’m drunk, although I swear

I’ve had no wine to drink.

You asked me to explain

Eternity for you –

Well certainly, when I

Have downed a drink or two.

Hafez, my nature’s like

A hopeful bride, but I

Lack mirrors to array

Myself – that’s why I sigh.





MY BODY’S DUST IS AS A VEIL


Spread out to hide

My soul – happy that moment when

It’s drawn aside!

To cage a songbird with so sweet

A voice is wrong –

I’ll fly to paradise’s garden

Where I belong.

But why I’ve come and whence I came

Is all unclear –

Alas, to know so little of

My being here!

How can I make my journey to

My heavenly home

When I’m confined and cramped within

This flesh and bone?

If my blood smells of longing, show no

Astonishment –

Mine is the musk deer’s pain as he

Secretes his scent.

Don’t think my golden shirt is like

A candle’s light –

The true flame burns beneath my shirt,

Hidden from sight.

Come, and ensure Hafez’s being

Will disappear –

Since You exist, no one will hear

Me say, “I’m here.”





THE MUSKY MORNING BREEZE


Will gently blow again,

Once more the old world will

Turn young and grow again;

White jasmine will take wine

From glowing Judas trees,

Narcissi fondly glance

At shy anemones;

Once more the banished, lovelorn

Nightingale will bring

His passion to the rose

And there sublimely sing;

And if I leave the mosque

For wine, don’t sneer at me –

Sermons are long, and time

Moves on incessantly.

My heart, if you postpone

Today’s enjoyment, who

Will guarantee the cash

Of happiness to you?

Drink before fasting, drink,

Don’t put your glass down yet –

Since Ramadan draws near

And pleasure’s sun must set.

How sweet the roses are!

Enjoy them now, for they

As quickly as they bloomed

Will fall and fade away.

We’re all friends here, my boy,

Sing love songs! Why should you

Sing yet again, “As that

Has gone, so this must too”?

You are why Hafez lives –

But now, within your heart,

Prepare to say farewell,

Since he too must depart.





IF THAT SHIRAZI TURK WOULD TAKE


My heart within his loving hand

I’d give for his dark mole the towns

Of Bokhara and Samarqand;

Come boy, and pour the wine’s last drops –

Since heaven’s courts will not provide

The gardens of our Mosalla

Or Roknabad’s green riverside.

Alas, these rowdy, sweet-voiced gypsies

Have ripped out patience from my heart,

Like Turks who make off with a feast’s

Leftovers when the guests depart.

My friend’s great beauty has no need

Of a defective love like mine -

A lovely face does not require

Cosmetic arts to make it shine.

Let’s talk of wine and music, not

Of Fate, and how the heavens revolve -

Theirs is a riddle no man’s wisdom

Has solved yet, or will ever solve.

Given the beauty Joseph had

I understood love could not fail

To tempt Zuleikha to discard

Her chastity’s enclosing veil.

You slandered me, and you spoke well –

May God forgive you what you said!

A bitter answer suits such lips,

So sugar-sweet and ruby-red.

But listen to advice, my dear -

Those who are young and fortunate

Prefer the wisdom of the old

To their own souls’ uncertain state.

Hafez, your poem’s written now,

The pearl you’ve pierced is poetry’s;

Sing sweetly – heaven grants your verse

The necklace of the Pleiades.





FLIRTATIOUS GAMES, AND YOUTH,


And wine like rubies glowing;

Convivial company,

And drink that’s always flowing;

A sweet-mouthed boy to serve

And sweet-voiced singers too,

An elegant, dear friend

Who’s seated next to you;

A kindly youngster whose

Delightful purity

Would stir the Fount of Youth

To angry jealousy –

A stealer of men’s hearts

Whose charm and loveliness

Would make the moon herself

Turn pale and envious;

A meeting place as though

Heaven’s high courts surround us,

With paradise’s roses

Profusely growing round us;

Kind-hearted friends to drink with,

Servants who act discreetly,

Companions who keep secrets,

Whom we can trust completely;

With wine as red as roses,

Astringent, light to sip,

Whose tale is garnets, rubies,

Kissed in a lover’s lip;

The server’s glance to be

A sword to plunder reason,

The lovers’ curls like snares

To trip hearts with their treason;

A wit like Hafez, all

Sweet-talk and repartee,

A patron like Qavam,

Whose generosity

Lights up the world…and may

The man who turns away

From pleasures such as these

Not know one happy day!





A BLACK MOLE GRACED HIS FACE; HE STRIPPED, AND SHONE


Incomparable in splendor as the moon;

He was so slim his heart was visible,

As if clear water sluiced a granite stone.





DESIRE’S DESTROYED MY LIFE; WHAT GIFTS HAVE I


Been given by the blindly turning sky?

And, such is my luck, everyone I said

“Dear friend” to loathed me by and by.





WHAT DOES LIFE GIVE ME IN THE END BUT SORROW?


What do love’s good and evil send but sorrow?

I’ve only seen one true companion – pain,

And I have known no faithful friend but sorrow.





EACH FRIEND TURNED OUT TO BE AN ENEMY,


Corruption rotted all their “purity”;

They say the night is pregnant with new times,

But since no men are here, how can that be?





WITH WINE BESIDE A GENTLY FLOWING BROOK – THIS IS BEST;


Withdrawn from sorrow in some quiet nook – this is best;

Our life is like a flower’s that blooms for ten short days,

Bright laughing lips, a friendly fresh-faced look – this is best.
